# Example Pelican Site
This site is the sample project created during my multi-part blog series [over on my blog](https://frankcorso.dev).

This sample is meant to help you:

1. Create your static site ([read the blog post](https://frankcorso.dev/setting-up-pelican-static-site-generator.html))
2. Customize the theme (post coming soon)
3. Deploy to the free plan on Netlify ([read the blog post](https://frankcorso.dev/deploying-your-pelican-static-site-to-netlify.html))
